# Tic-tac-toe

This repository contains AI implementations for the popular paper-and-pencil
game known as Tic-tac-toe. There is also a GUI-based game that allows the user
to play against the computer.

# Racket Code

You will need, as you may assume, a Racket distribution in order to run the
Racket programs.

Running the interactive game will allow you to play against the computer.

This should be as simple as

```bash
$ racket game.rkt
```

The algorithm is an implementation of na√Øve minimax. The implementation is very
slow due to the lack of optimizations. This may be fixed in the future.

# Continuous Integration Status
